{"name":"The Techpriest","tagline":"Programming by Robert Richter","body":"### Age of Exploration\r\n\r\nMy personal programming projects are hosted at the link below. I am employed as a web programmer at a big financial institution, and most of the professional work I do is in Java and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nI recently graduated with a degree in computer engineering so I'm a little behind on the more modern programming languages and techniques, but I am catching up. Since I work with Java web app frameworks at work, I've been learning the more modern ones like Django and Rails in my free time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback on my code, please contact me--via GitHub preferably. I would really appreciate criticism.
